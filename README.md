How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

There are many ways to do so- though none are full proof.
Static testing is the first and easiest, though there are inherent biases- for instance it is easy to overlook things you think are already fine.
Secondly we have dynamic testing. It can often find issues quiet quickly- think of a game and in it while playing you end up clipping through a wall!
JUnit tests are another to basically do alot of tests on it.

For security we must make sure the code is efficient and good. We should ensure there aren't extraneous pieces of spaghetti code, but we should also make sure our machines are safe-
a safe machine is a safe(r) piece of software.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Step One is just to listen. Understand every single thing a user needs and, based on that, start designing the end goals of the software.
After figuring out the end goals make a plot to get there- and also ask questions to further clarify needs. Maybe a user didn't realize his inventory management software could benefit from other ideas for instance.

How do I approach designing software?

My approach is to, as stated, start from the end. After that I make pseudocode, and then real code. This was not always my approach- as a modder I just attacked it until it worked like a cave man
beating a tiger with a bone club. But now I take a slow and methodical approach to ensure success.
